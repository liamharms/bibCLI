# bibCLI
## A (very) useful and simple command line Bible tool
v 0.0.5

## Features
- Multiple translations
- Query any verse
- Search by keywords

## Installation
### On Linux:
1. `git clone https://liamharms/bibCLI`
2. `cd bibCLI`
3. `make`
### Other Systems:
- You'll have to manually compile it. It's super simple though; [`main.c`](./src/main.c) is literally the only file you have to compile. (you'll need the `-lsqlite3` flag) 

## Usage
`./bibCLI -h` will give you a help dialog that explains everything.

## Plans for the future
- Verse of the Day
- Support for commentaries, primarily targeting Early Church fathers and Reformers
- Support for confessions and creeds
- A TUI for no-arg calls (i.e. `./bibCLI`)
